<!-- INTRO CASE STUDY-->
    <article class="case-description">
    <p class="first">T<span class="small-caps">he doyle collection</span> is an Irish family owned Luxury Boutique Hotel company that has 8 properties in the <span class="small-caps-t">US</span>, Ireland and the <span class="small-caps-t">UK</span>.  When I started studying <span class="small-caps-t">UX</span> and Design, I was working concurrently as the Doyle Collection's Dupont Circle Hotel on the marketing, sales and event team.  The company re-designed and  launched a new website, and I served on the web committee, which gathered feedback from management and guests about the site, and proposed changes to the corporate office.  The launching of a new website presented a great opportunity to get my feet wet with learning about <span class="small-caps-t">UX</span> research by conducting a usability study.  The guest experience doesn't start at check in, it begins when they land on your site;  I proposed my study to management and received their support.</p>

<!--CASE STUDY TEXT _ DISCOVER AND DEFINE SECTION-->            
<h2>Discover and Define</h2>
        <p>To begin my study, I interviewed to the different department heads and learned about what their feedback and challenges were with the website.  It was an ideal start by learning about their perspective, as the operations team has a lot of face to face time with the guest and had the best insight into the guest expectations, as defined by what they see on the website.

 
</p>
    <p class="text-indent">Next, I put together a test script, which was intended to 1)define the study's objectives<span>1</span>, 2) define the ideal participant qualifications, 3)define the setting the testing environment 4) establish introduction procedures, 5) define key tasks<span>2</span>, 6) define scenarios to acheive tasks 7) post-testing questionnaire. Once the test plan was completed, I searched for test participants.

<p> The usability test was formatted to learn about the user’s interaction, browsing and navigation through the website.  The data collected  was primarily qualitative findings, through observations of the user behavior from visual presentations and assigned tasks.

</p> 
        
  <p class="text-indent">The actual testing took place at participants  home and/or offices, which was prefered as it was a natural environment (one participant was tested remotely), and  each session lasted f between 60-90 minutes. The Users were asked to search and find the “Dupont Circle Hotel” main landing page, and describe their initial reaction and were free to browse the site, while expressing their perceptions.  The users were then assigned specific tasks and/or scenarios to navigate through, while the I observed their behavior<sup>4</sup>.  The tasks, scenarios, and observations were formulated based on the following objectives to gain user insight

        <p class="text-indent">The most promising sketch,<em> it seemed</em>, was a single page layout with a fixed navigation to the left.  I liked this design because it offered the user a convenient navigation through the information, while allowing the content to be in a 100% viewport height container for easier reading. I drafted the mock-up design in <span class="small-caps-t">HTML/CSS</span> to see how it looked in the browser  but the results were disappointing<sup>5</sup>, though there were some aspects I liked<sup>6</sup>.  In addition, the fonts the client requested<sup>7</sup> were not indicative of the studio’s desired academic, yet fun image. Since I had spent so much time designing this version, I kept trying to salvage what I had to make it better, but it just didn’t work.  This experience proved to be one of  the most valuable design lessons – <strong>Don’t be afraid throw away a bad design and start over, from the beginning</strong>.

<p class="text-indent">Before going back to the drawing boards, I connected with the client to discuss the challenges with the requested fonts.  Sharing my research about Typography, I walked him through my thought process to finding the right type. Influencing my selctions, was based on the studio’s primary teaching of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Haydn" class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">Haydn’s</a> work and other prolific classical music from the 1700’s – mid 1800’s.  I expressed the importance of the right typeface choice to properly represent the personality of his studio, and emphasized the extensive research and trial and error that goes into creating outstanding typographic styling.   The client understood and offered me full creative control in this realm, another valuable lesson,  <strong>address issues sooner, not later, don’t wait!</strong>. With that, I went back to the drawing board<sup>10</sup> with a new perspective and a fresh start.

The opening paragraph statement is intended to offer a warm welcome to any prospective students, while the complementary imagery reinforces the studio’s ambiance and services.  For the mobile version, I included an auto scrolling parallaxing image gallery<sup>12</sup> to the landing page and removed the scattered images to prioritize the written content, yet still offer the user some imagery of the studio without taking up valuable mobile real estate.  Also, I included a map<sup>13</sup>  to the mobile homepage and contact to provide easy access to students navigating to the studio via their mobile devices.

<p class="text-indent">Toward the later part of the development process, I wanted to get a temperature check on the overall design of the site. Reaching out to fellow designers and friends,  I received some key critical feedback and findings: 1) A user reported having initial trouble going back to the home page, because there was not a link in the navigation, but eventually clicked the logo to get back.  This was an oversight on my part, though the logo was linked to the homepage, all pages needed to be included in the navigation - therefore I added the “about” to link back to the landing page. 2) Another user reported that while they liked the site welcoming design of the pages, he felt it was missing the same personal connection from Matthew, the teacher.   This influenced the final design of the contact page<sup>24</sup>, including a final statement in Matthew’s words thanking the user for visiting and inviting them to get together over coffee to discuss their musical journey.

<p>Overall, this site was a  significant lesson in <strong>empathy</strong>.  Feeling and understanding what others are expressing, even if you don’t agree with them, is a powerful way of connecting.  Whether I was seeking to understand what users were looking for, or proposing an alternative solution to the client - An empathetic approach not only  sharpened my ideas, but got to the bottom of what’s relevant and important.

The website was in need of some serious updating.  

I wasn't expecting nearly anything so beautiful as Kyle created.  While we did butt heads now and then over style and approach, I feel that we always understood each other on an essential level.  Having now had this website live for several months, my traffic has increased, my business' prestige has expanded, and community arts organizations that I have corporately affiliated with (The Washington Performing Arts Society, The Washington Ballet at the Kennedy Center) have commented on the professionalism and the polish of my public image and presentation.  

Kyle has elevated my business profile, been a tireless advocate for my public image, and works constantly to make sure my site is both functioning at a high level and getting noticed.  I find myself continually astonished at how dedicated Kyle has been, and how fortunate I am to have been able to work with him on this project."
