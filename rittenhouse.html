    <article class="case-description">
        <p class="first">S<span class="small-caps">uzanne</span> Frie is the amazingly talented artist behind Rittenhouse, which is her “old family” name and signature on all her art.  We met when I was working at <a href="https://www.kimptonhotels.com/stay/hotel-solamar-san-diego" target="_blank" class="link hvr-underline-reveal">Kimpton Hotels</a> in San Diego, and I invited her to join a community art show I organized at the hotel featuring local artists’ work.   Recently, Suzanne moved to Hawaii, and is working to break into the art scene there and further promote her work.  I’m thrilled to have partnered with her on a website project that advances her beautiful art, and such a great learning opportunity for me in showcasing visual content.</p>

<h2>Discover and Define</h2>
<p>I began this project by learning more about the art world including the top online art <a href="https://www.artsy.net/" class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">merchants</a>, other artist’s <a href="http://banksy.co.uk/" class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">websites</a>, and exploring <a href="http://www.si.edu/museums" class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">museums</a>.  This was an educational experience as much as it was a competitive analysis; looking for inspiration that showcased art well<span>1</span> and finding things that I did not like<span>2</span>.

<!-- User Needs-->
<p class="text-indent">Suzanne had very clear needs for the site: 1) A site for the art to stand out and nothing else.  2) didn't want the writing to be in first person, 3) nor did she want a picture of herself. The pieces and prices that she wanted were well defined, as she had four collections and a handful of other pieces that she wanted to be on there.  
</p>
                     
        
        
 <!-- DESIGN AND DEVELOP SECTION--> 
        
<h2 class="top">Design and Develop</h2>
<p>Given the nature of the content, primarily images of paintings, I knew that I didn’t have much leeway in cropping the pics since that would compromise the art.  I needed to know exactly what aspect ratios I was working with before getting into sketches or even thinking about layout ideas, while many of the physical pieces were the same width, the photography was not.  I got all the images in photoshop and grouped them by aspect ratio sizes, to find the ones that were similar, the same, and different.  This process offered an ideal foundation in influencing the type of design options available.  I had been thinking about some design ideas that didn't work at all with the given collateral, so this was a valuable lesson that taught me the importance of <strong>ensuring that you understand your collateral at hand, before thinking about design</strong>.

</p>           
        
  <!-- NEW P-->        
        <p class="text-indent">Next, I started sketching ideas, conceptualized a design with an opening page that featured an opening page that switched images upon opening, and 4 separate pages to feature the various art collections and a about/contact page. I mocked-it up in sketch to get a feel for the layout, and was concerned about 1) all the clicking to get through the galleries 2) the thumbnail image gallery, because the thumbnails were distracting from the enlarged piece 3) concerned about bouncing user out of the site too soon with five pages.    From my earlier research, I had developed a clear understanding of what I wanted and didn’t want, and this design was lining up with the latter.   I scrapped the entire design.

<p class="text-indent">Before going back to the drawing boards, I connected with the client to discuss the challenges with the requested typefaces. The studio primarily teaches Haydn’s work and other classical music from the 1700’s – mid 1800’s, which influenced my typeface preferences for the project, so I communicated this process to the client;  in addition to the importance of the right typeface choice to properly represent the personality of his studio, and emphasized the extensive research and trial and error that goes into creating outstanding typographic styling. Once the client understood and offered me full creative control, another valuable lesson,  <strong>address issues sooner, not later, don’t wait!</strong>. With that, I went back to the drawing boards<sup>10</sup> with a new perspective and a fresh start.

              <p class="text-indent">The ideal layout that evolved separated the sections into individual pages, which allowed the content to be more digestible and provided more space for the images to pop out. I wanted to ensure the landing page<sup>11</sup> included the logo of the studio, what it does tagline, navigation options, and a way to learn more. The opening paragraph statement is intended to offer a warm welcome to any prospective students, while the complementary imagery reinforces the studio’s ambiance and services.  For the mobile version I included an auto scrolling parallaxing image gallery<sup>12</sup> to the landing page and removed the scattered images to prioritize the written content, yet still offer the user some imagery of the studio without taking up valuable mobile real estate.  Also, I included a map<sup>13</sup>  to the mobile homepage and contact to provide easy access to students navigating to the studio via their mobile devices.

The drop cap<sup>14</sup>  styling adds to the academic feel desired.  After the intro, the Studio’s styles and methods are summed up with the section titled “What Styles Will I Learn”, which heading title was inspired by my earlier informal research.  Organized from my earlier content edits, the lesson policies is sectioned into chunks and styled with small-caps <sup>15</sup> which allows the user to scan through quickly to review what is pertinent to them.

<p class="text-indent">Due to the pricing page’s unusual title terms (Proficient, Technical, Professional), I was seeking a pricing option design<sup>16</sup> that would clearly communicate what title was relevant to the prospective student's skillset. Ultimately, the best solution was to ask and answer the question: “Who’s this for?. This solution was space efficient, and concisely describes the qualifications for the price accordingly.

<p class="text-indent">When considering where to include the social media review links,  I didn't want the links to potentially bounce users out of the site, by only adding a link to the nav-bar or footer.  The solution was to add a dedicated  review page to the site<sup>17</sup> , that displayed the links in the same theme of 3’s format; in addition to personalized reviews from current students of different skill backgrounds<sup>18</sup> , by design to connect and attract any prospective student’s reviewing with a similar skillset.

<p class="text-indent">Toward the later part of the development process, I wanted to get a temperature check on the overall design and usability. Reaching out to fellow designers and friends,  I received some key critical findings. 1) A user reported having initial trouble going back to the home page, because there was not a link in the navigation, but eventually clicked the logo to get back.  This was an oversight on my part, though the logo was linked to the homepage, all pages needed to be included in the navigation. 2) another user reported that while they liked the site design welcoming of the pages, he felt it was missing the same personal connection from Matthew, the teacher.   This influenced the final design of the contact page<sup>19</sup>, including a final statement in Matthew’s words thanking the user for visiting and inviting them to get together over coffee to discuss their musical journey.
