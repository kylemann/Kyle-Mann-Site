<!-- INTRO CASE STUDY-->
    <article class="case-description">
        <p class="first">Thank you for the opportunity to work on the design exercise</a> – I’m looking forward to sharing my process and reasoning behind the solution.</p>
    
    <p>I began by learning more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product" class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">GDP</a>, reading recent <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-moody-has-downgraded-indias-gdp-growth-projection/" class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">articles</a> , and reviewing online GDP graphs that I <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD/countries/1W?display=graph" class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">admired</a>.  This was intended to get in the right mindset as I proceeded with my design.</p>
    
<p>Next, I reviewed the data in the excel sheet and looked at the numbers and graphs, seeking trends, outliers, patterns, highs/lows, median, mean.  I reviewed the numbers without any preconceived idea of what I wanted to do with them; I was just looking to organize the data and get to know it deeply. </p>
    
    <p>Once the data was organized, I began thinking about the <em>who, what, when, where</em> and <em>why</em> the project was being made, starting by asking myself: <strong>“Is the project intended to be explanatory or exploratory?”</strong>  Given the nature of the assignment, I decided it was <strong>exploratory</strong>.  Then I channeled my audience (you), noting key details to keep in mind throughout the process so I could ensure I was designing relevant material accordingly.</p>
    
    
                   <div class="annotation-flex">
                            <div class="annotation2">
                                <h3>the audience</h3>
                    <ul>
      
                        <li><b>Culture:</b> Western, Designers</li>
                        <li><b>Level of Expertise:</b> Very high</li>
                        <li><b>Need:</b> Simplicity and creativity
</li>
                        <li><b>Accessibility:</b> Possible colorblindness</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                            </div>

    
  
</div>
    
    <p>Now that I had researched the world of GDP, channeled my audience, and identified the 6 w’s, I finalized the content to be presented; including 1) each individual country’s GDP changes (using bar graph to best display high/lows/changes) 2) each country’s changes over 6 decades (using a line graph for clear comparing/contrasting) 3) individual country’s average GDP yearly changes 4) individual country’s highest and lowest yearly change  5) a non-biased, clear header that explains the data</p>
    
    
                  <div class="annotation-flex">
                            <div class="annotation2">
                                <h3>header</h3>
                    <ul style="list-style:none;">
      
                        <li><strike>City GDP Changes</strike></li>
               <li><strike>GDP Changes in 5 Countries</strike></li>
                        <li><strike>Global GDP Growth</strike></li>
                        <li><strike>5 Country’s GDP Change</strike></li>
                        <li><strike>Six Decades with GDP Change</strike></li>
                        <li>Six Decades of GDP Change</li>
                    </ul>
                            </div>

    
  
</div>
    
    <p>With the content requirement set, I jumped into sketching layouts, fleshing out one idea after another.  Then, once I had a number of layouts I felt comfortable with, I began working on graphs in Illustrator, so I had all my content <em>and</em> collateral together before settling on a layout.  Once I had completed the graphs, I started to work with them and visualized how they fit into my different layout ideas. I settled on the final layout to best illustrate the graphs and summary data, allowing the user to compare and contrast the individual countries and collective graphs side by side. Included at the bottom is an executive summary to conclude the review, and to highlight high-level findings. Even though some countries averaged higher/lower percentile changes than others, I purposefully listed the items randomly, as the data was intended to be more <em>exploratory</em> than explanatory. </p>
    
    <section class="bottom-review">
                           
                                        <blockquote class="review-quote">“Above all else show the data......Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space."

                        </section>
    
    <p>In conclusion, this exercise got me even more excited about working with you all.  I learned a lot about GDP changes, and more importantly about how to better prioritize, explore, and deploy data.  Thank you again for the opportunity to do this exercise.
