    <article class="case-description">
    <p class="first">C<span class="small-caps">abrina mclain</span>, founder and operator of <i>The Experience</i>, was referred to me by my former boss <a href=”https://www.linkedin.com/pub/brian-price/1a/b4b/722” class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">Brian Price</a>, to work on a new website and brand image.  About a year ago, Cabrina began Life Coach Consulting as a side job, and her client base grew so much that she decided to transition into a full time consultant.  This presented a great design and development opportunity, as well as an ideal partnership, as she and I were both working toward transitioning our careers.

<h2>Discover and Define</h2>
<p>Starting with a phone conversation, I began by getting to know Cabrina and learning about her background and finding out what inspires her.  Her services, life coaching consulting, are very up close and personal, so it made sense learn about her personality.  I also learned about her needs and desired outcomes<sup>1</sup> of the new website, as well as things she did not want<sup>2</sup>.  We also discussed her target customers<sup>3</sup> at length and business model for gaining new customers, which is primarily through 1) referrals of past customers and 2) sending out promotional emails about her service and links to the website.

<p class="text-indent">The client's previous site<sup>4</sup> was a wordpress created site, that had six different pages outlining the services and company bio.  I suggested to her that the written content stay short and concise for each service 1)state what the service does 2) what the customer can expect as an outcome, and 3) why they should sign up.  This way, the prospective customer can get right to the bottom of what the services are and how the service will benefit them.  I outlined the customer’s journey, based on her business model of referrals and prospecting, pointing out that she had the attention of the user when they visited the site and their time on the site was best used to further educate those visitors about her services.  She agreed with the content direction and working with her on this content strategy taught me a valuable lesson  -<strong>when proposing solutions to a client - always keep your focus on the customer</strong>.

<h2 class="top">Design and Develop</h2>
<p>
I began sketching layout ideas<sup>5</sup>, envisioning a simple one page layout for easy navigating, reading, and a quick review.  Most of my sketches were one page layout ideas, but just for fun I tested the waters sketching layouts with separated pages<sup>6</sup> - Just to see if anything popped out.  Ultimately, I identified two layouts that looked promising (both single page layouts) which worked pretty well.  The first option<sup>7a</sup> was a simple and clean layout that featured the content without distraction, easy to read through and digestible.  The second<sup>7b</sup> was more ambitious in visual design including additional colors, vertical text, and additional layers emphasizing certain headers.  Both were intriguing and I developed both  <span class=”small-caps-t”>HTML/CSS</span> to compare the designs in the browser.

        <p class="text-indent">Once developed, I became very attached to 9b, but was still unsure which one to move forward . Deciding to shelf the decision between the two layouts, in the interim, I worked on the areas both designs shared in common: 1) the header, 2) logo, and 3) contact section.  I wanted to ensure the landing page was warm, inviting, friendly, and humble, yet confident.  Brainstorming  different header taglines<sup>8a</sup>, guided by my initial client interview, I wrote down the pro’s and con’s of each idea - which concluded none of them were appropriate or indicative of the services offered.  Consolidating a list<sup>9</sup> of pros and cons then guided  the final outcome - which was a statement  of simplicity: “Let’s begin our Journey of Change” - “One session, one discovery, one goal at a time ”.  The reasoning for this header was threefold - 1) it stated the intention of all the services which is “Change”  2) it stated the services to fulfill that objective, being “one session, one discovery, one goal at a time”, and 3) it mirrored the voice of Cabrina’s personality and the key objective of her service.

<p class="text-indent">In finding the right imagery for the site, I looked to the client needs and personas to guide me.  I was initially tempted to use photos of Cabrina with a client, but that was too business-like and had the connotation of therapy.   Also a number of her clients are stay at home mothers, and having business-like photos pigeonholed the services to business consulting and sent the wrong message of her services overall.  Reminding myself of the variety of different personas and client need of holistic styling, I turned to nature.  Nature offers pictures of warmth, serenity and help assemble a palette of calming colors.

<p class="text-indent">I had been sketching logo ideas throughout the process, though having been unsuccessful so far I decided to write down exactly what I wanted the Logo<sup>11</sup> to signify and then started over with a vision.  With a new direction, I began sketching a lot of shapes, primarily triangles, with the idea of <a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html">Maslow’s “Hierarchy of Needs”</a> relating to Life Coaching.  While I liked the concept, I ultimately  decided  not to use the triangular shape as a <em>main focus</em>, because it’s connotation insinuates <em>moving up</em>, rather than the client’s emphasis to <em>moving forward</em>.   This guided me to the final result<sup>12</sup>, a circular graphic that has a sense of motion, intertwined with another inner circle adding visual motion and signifying partnerships.   The circular foundation included a square on the inside, which by connection to the circle forms <em>subtle</em> triangles, indicative of the structured progress toward change <em>The Experience</em> team offers

<p class="text-indent">Overall, it was clear that that while the second design was more visually intriguing, it was less likely to be read thoroughly - taking away from the key objective.  Once again a great learning opportunity -<strong> just because it’s pretty doesn't mean anything if it’s not useful</strong>.

<p>The project overall was a grand lesson in <strong>perspective</strong> -  The client's perspective, my perspective, the personas and the real life user’s perspective.   Everyone has different investments, objectives, and goals, which need to be carefully considered .  In this project, my perspective was creating an ambitious design and, therefore, was initially drawn to a design that didn't fully meet the needs of the client.  I learned the importance of objectively identifying the perspectives  for all parties involved, setting aside my own motifs, and the design accordingly.  The client's message was simple and clear, and in the end that’s the message that should resonate in the design
