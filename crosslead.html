            <h1>Product design with the team of teams</h1>
            <p><a href="https://crosslead.com/" target="_blank">CrossLead</a> is a consulting services and software firm, that uses technology to augment the client service practice and offers a SaaS web application. The organization is lead by former Navy Seal <a href="https://crosslead.com/about/david-silverman/" target="_blank">David Silverman</a>, who is the co-writer of the NY Times bestselling book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Team-Teams-Rules-Engagement-Complex/dp/1591847486/ref=asc_df_1591847486/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312025907421&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13996641044245348988&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061285&hvtargid=pla-489327297327&psc=1" target="_blank">Team of Teams</a>.

            <h3>Optimize for shipping</h3>
            <p>CrossLead decided to make a bet and invest in a new business endeavor to build out a SaaS web application. This is where I came in as their first full time designer to lead product design. On a tight budget: ruthless prioritization and immediate shipping was our focus. Here are the immediate actions I started upon joining the team:
                <br>
                <br> Partnered with engineers on finding a design framework aligned with our tech stack (react and ruby); we chose <a href="https://ant.design/" target="_blank">ant design</a>. The design system strategy outline: we ship with this framework and layer in styling as we ship. This optimized for shipping and allowed us to build the design system and react UI library foundation on the go.
                <br>
                <br> Simultaneously, collaborated with the PMs and CEO to establish the immediate priorities to focus on and what not to focus on. I talked with the wider team: sales, customer success, marketing, and finance to understand the business model and bottom line: why are customers paying us money? Who are our customers? What do they love about us? What are the challenges they are experiencing? Additionally, I met directly with customers to learn about their engagement feedback and joined consultants in their workshops.
                <br>
                <br> Based on my findings: of the many features and migration needs (from the legacy tools built), we identified the most unique product differentiation was the “single page view”. This concept is the core of the consulting service and tranlated to the SaaS tool: helping customers understand their organization's performance, structure, and planning.</p>

        <div class="headwrap2">
            <h3>Learn and grow</h3>
            <p> My time as CrossLead was an incredibly informative experience. To start: we built an application and design system from scratch. Our initial features shipped were not pretty and had a lot of bubble gum and duct tape glueing them together. However we evolved by: thinking big, executing our hypothesis, and embracing uncertainty. These factors resulted in fast decision making, continual feedback, and growth. I learned by doing that the greatest competitive advantage is continual measured risk-taking and experimentation: shipping ideas to real life volatility. This optimized the team to think in terms of return on risk, which makes failure successful because you learn from your mistakes and move on. One small step at a time, we were able to build out a more cohesive, usable, and valuable tool for our customers.
                <br>
                <br> I'll never forget on my last night, the team took me out and the <span class="small-caps">CEO</span> said to me: “fair winds and following seas”, a traditional Navy salute to departing members. A shared sentiment of team gratitude. </p>
