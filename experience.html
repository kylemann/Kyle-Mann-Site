    <p class="first">C<span class="small-caps">abrina</span>, founder and operator of The Experience, was referred to me by my former boss Brian Price, to work with her on a new website and brand image.  About a year ago, Cabrina began Life Coach Consulting as a side job, and her client base grew so much that she decided to transition into a full time consultant.  This prepresented a great design and development opportunity, as well as a great partnership, as she and I were both working toward transitioning our careers.

<h2>Discover and Define</h2>
        <p>Starting with a phone conversation, I began by getting to know Cabrina and learning about her background and finding out what inspires her.  Her services, Life Coaching Consulting, are very up close and personal, so I really wanted to get a feel for her personality.  I also learned about her needs and desired outcomes<sup>1</sup> of the new website, as well as things she did not want<sup>2</sup>.  In addition, we discussed her target customers<sup>3</sup> business model for gaining new customers, which is primarily through referrals of past customers and Sending out promotional emails about her service and links to the website.

<p class="text-indent">The client's previous site<sup>4</sup> was a wordpress created site, that had six different pages outlining the services and company bio.  I suggested to her that the written content stay short and concise for each services 1)State what the service does 2) What the customer can expect as an outcome and 3) Why they should sign up.  This way, the prospective customer can get right to the bottom of what the services are and how the service will benefit them.  I outlined the customer’s journey, based on her business model of referrals and prospecting, pointing out that she had the attention of the user when they are visiting the site and their time on the site was best used to further educate those visitors about her services.  She agreed with the content direction and working with her on this content strategy taught me a valuable lesson in -<strong>when proposing solutions to a client - always keep your focus on the customer</strong> .

<p>
I began sketching layout ideas<sup>5</sup>, envisioning a simple one page layout for easy navigating, reading and a quick review.  Most of my sketches were one page layout ideas, but just for fun I tested the waters sketching layouts with separated pages<sup>6</sup> - Just to see if anything popped out.  Ultimately, I identified two layouts that looked promising (both single page layouts) which worked pretty well.  The first option<sup>7a</sup> was a simple and clean layout that featured the content without distraction, easy to read through and digestible.  The second<sup>7b</sup> was more ambitious in visual design including additionals colors, vertical text, and additional layers emphasizing certain headers.  Both were intriguing and I developed both in HTML/CSS to allow some side by side browser comparison.

        <p class="text-indent">Once developed, I became very attached to 9b, but was still unsure which one to move forward with. I decided to shelf the decision between the two layouts and worked on the areas both designs shared in common - the header, logo, and contact section.  I wanted to ensure the landing page was warm, inviting, friendly, and humble, yet confident.  Working with a number of heading tags, predicated on my interview with Cabrina, I worked through a number of possibilities<sup>8</sup> to get a number of options on the table.  Reviewing the different tagline designs one by one, I wrote down the pro’s and con’s of each - and decided none of them were appropriate or indicative of the services offered.  Consolidating a list<sup>9</sup> of pros and cons then guided me to the final outcome - which was a statement to simplicity: “Let’s begin our Journey of Change” - “One session, one discovery, one goal at a time ”.  The reasoning for this header was 3 fold - 1) it stated the intention of all the services which is “Change”, and 2) it stated the services to fulfill that objective, being “one session, one discovery, one goal at a time” 3) it mirrored the voice of Cabrina’s personality and the key objective of her service, as discovered through customer interviews.  The landing page has a tinted photo to 1) set the calming tone with the subtle blue and 2) to let the message be the center of attention, not the photo.

<p class="text-indent">In finding the right imagery for the site, I looked to the client needs and personas to guide me.  I was initially tempted to use photos of Cabrina with a client, but that proved to be too business like and had the connotation of therapy.   Also a number of her clients are stay at home mothers, and having business like photos pigeonholed the services to business consulting and sent the wrong message of her services overall.  Reminding myself of the variety of different personas and client needs and look holistically, I turned to nature.  Nature offers pictures of warmth, serenity and an assembled a palette of colors.

<p class="text-indent">I had been sketching logo ideas throughout the process, though having been unsuccessful so far I decided to write down exactly what I wanted the Logo<sup>11</sup> to signify and then started over with more structure.  With a new direction, I began sketching a lot of shapes, primarily triangles, with the idea of Maslow’s “Hierarchy of Needs” relating to Life Coaching.  But, that didn't really make sense or align with the clients services - a triangle insinuates a hierarchy by nature, and that wasn't indicative of The Experience coaching services.  In my discussions with the client she emphasized her services are personal and egalitarian.  This guided me to the final result<sup>12</sup>, which is a simple, circular graphic that has a sense of motion, intertwined with another inner circle adding visual motion and signifying partnerships.  The circular foundation included a square on the inside, which gives the the graphic a sense of structure, indicative of the structured progressive change The Experience has to offer.
