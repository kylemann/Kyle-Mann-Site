    <p class="first">I <span class="small-caps">partnered</span> with Matthew Viator from Studio V, a piano and musicology studio based in Washington DC, to design a new website and brand image. The studio prides itself in being the most academic and serious studio in DC and needed to rebrand its web presence to communicate that message and attract the ideal students.</p>
    <a href="http://mviator.com/" target="_blank"><div class="case-website-button">View Studio V Website</div></a>
        
<h2>Discover and Define</h2>
        <p>We started the project by getting together over breakfast to discuss the studio services, future plans, objectives and needs<sup>1</sup>.  I wanted to learn about how Matthew wanted his studio to be portrayed, what kind of brand image he desired, who he wanted as a student, and understand the why to those questions.  This was purely an informative interview; I left my worldview and opinion’s at the door. </p>

            <h3>1. client needs</h3>
        <ul>
        
    
        
      
        <li>Site to feel academic, yet modern and fun.</li>
        <li>To have terms, conditions, and studio policies posted</li>
        <li>Include pricing for the various levels, without using the terms beginner, intermediate, and advanced</li>
        <li>Include a lot of written content describing his background, and the studio’s description, policies and student expectations.</li>
        <li>Attract serious students</li>
        <li>Requested to try include a Gotham and XXX typeface in the design </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
    <p>After learning about the clients needs, I began to identify the prospective users needs<sup>2</sup>. I attended one and the studios monthly social, and got to know some of the students and learned about what they expected and wanted of a site from a prospective teacher.  Nearly every person responded with the same needs, namely location, pricing, and “styles taught”.  I made note of the repeated use of “styles taught”.  The Studio’s previous website<sup>3</sup> did not include any of the user listed needs on the homepage, a confusing interface and didn’t have a brand Image or logo; however, the site did include easily accessible studio policies and expectations, which were useful to past visitors, as mentioned by one of his current students, and valuable information for the future design.</p>
