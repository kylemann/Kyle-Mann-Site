Fueled by curiosity and a dash of naiveté college buddies, Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis return to their ancestral home of Greene, Iowa to figure out how a modest kernel conquered America. With the help of some real farmers, oodles of fertilizer and government aid, and some genetically modified seeds the friends manage to grow one acre of corn. Along the way they unlock the hilarious absurdities and scary but hidden truths about America's modern food system.</p></div>

Birth is a miracle, a rite of passage, a natural part of life. But birth is also big business. The film interlaces intimate birth stories with surprising historical, political and scientific insights and shocking statistics about the current maternity care system.
When director Epstein discovers she is pregnant during the making of the film, the journey becomes even more personal. Should most births be viewed as a natural life process, or should every delivery be treated as a potentially catastrophic medical emergency?

From Al Gore's “An Inconvenient Truth” to news reports from the popular media outlets and even public classrooms, which seem to be screaming, “the sky is falling!” But is it really? This film blows the whistle on what it claims is the biggest swindle in modern history. We are told that Man Made Global Warming is the biggest threat ever to mankind and that it may even threaten our very survival. If we do not change our ways and reduce CO2 emissions, polar ice caps will melt, coastal areas will flood and hurricanes like Katrina will become common. There is absolutely no room for doubt because there is a scientific consensus. Anyone who questions the data or conclusion is an enemy of the state and humanity.

This documentary offers an in-depth investigation into the disturbing truth behind the unlabeled, patented, genetically engineered foods that have quietly filled U.S. grocery store shelves for the past decade. 

</p>
             
             <p data-brackets-id="996">From the prairies of Saskatchewan, Canada to the fields of Oaxaca, Mexico, this film gives a voice to farmers whose lives and livelihoods have been negatively impacted by this new technology. The health implications, government policies and push towards globalization are all part of the reason why many people are alarmed by the introduction of genetically altered crops into our food supply. 

The film examines the complex web of market and political forces that are changing what we eat as multinational corporations seek to control the world's food system. The film also explores alternatives to large-scale industrial agriculture, placing organic and sustainable agriculture as real solutions to the farm crisis today.

Wheeler (Scott) and Danny (Rudd) wouldn't necessarily be the first people a parent would turn to when seeking out a babysitter, in fact, they probably wouldn't even make the list in the first place. After slamming a few too many Minotaur energy drinks and crashing the company truck, however, the two loose-living pals narrowly avert jail when the court decides to let them become mentors to a group of young misfits. But how is the recently dumped Danny supposed to help bashful, role-playing geek Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) become a man when all he can offer the boy is bitter sarcasm, and is beer-chugging man-child Wheeler really the best choice to help foul-mouthed fifth-grader Ronnie (Bobb’e J. Thompson) develop more respect for his elders? Probably not, but they'll have to do their best anyway when the center's ex-con director (Jan Lynch) confronts them with a harsh ultimatum. Now, if Wheeler and Danny can just make it through the rest of their probation without getting tossed in jail, maybe there's hope for the boys -- and Danny's relationship with his fed-up girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) -- after all. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide

         <div data-brackets-id="1040" class="film-review"><p data-brackets-id="1041" class="first2">Why We Fight is a film by Eugene Jarecki which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. It is an unflinching look at the anatomy of the American war machine, weaving unforgettable personal stories with commentary by a "who's who" of military and beltway insiders. Featuring John McCain, William Kristol, Chalmers Johnson, Gore Vidal, Richard Perle and others, Why We Fight launches a bipartisan inquiry into the workings of the military industrial complex and the rise of the American Empire. 
</p>
             <p data-brackets-id="1042">Inspired by Dwight Eisenhower's legendary farewell speech (in which he coined the phrase "military industrial complex"), filmmaker Jarecki surveys the scorched landscape of a half-century's military adventures, asking how--and telling why--a nation of, by, and for the people has become the savings-and-loan of a system whose survival depends on a state of constant war. The film moves beyond the headlines of various American military operations to the deeper questions of why: why does America fight? What are the forces--political, economic, ideological--that drive us to fight against an ever-changing enemy? </p>
             
             <blockquote data-brackets-id="1043">"Frank Capra made a series of films during World War II called <span data-brackets-id="1044" class="small-caps">'why we fight'</span> that explored America's reasons for entering the war," Jarecki notes. "Today, with our troops engaged in Iraq and elsewhere for reasons far less clear, I think it's crucial to ask the questions: 'Why are we doing what we are doing? What is it doing to others? And what is it doing to us?' " </blockquote>

             <p data-brackets-id="1062">They're all part of growing up for the smart, fearless heroine of the groundbreaking animated film "Persepolis." Writer and director Marjane Satrapi draws a poignant story about a young girl in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. Through her eyes, we see a people's hopes dashed as fundamentalists take power--forcing the veil on women and imprisoning thousands. Young Marjane outsmarts the "social guardians" and discovers punk, ABBA and Iron Maiden.
