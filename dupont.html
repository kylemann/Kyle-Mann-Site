<!-- INTRO CASE STUDY-->
    <article class="case-description">
    <p class="first">T<span class="small-caps">he dupont circle hotel</span> is part of The Doyle Collection,  an Irish family-owned luxury boutique hotel company, comprised of  8 properties in the  <span class="small-caps-t">US</span>, Ireland and the <span class="small-caps-t">UK</span>.  When I began studying <span class="small-caps-t">UX</span> Design, I was working concurrently at the Dupont Circle Hotel’s marketing, sales, and event team.  The company re-designed and  launched a new website, and I served on the web committee, which gathered feedback from management and guests about the site, and proposed changes to the corporate office.  The launching of a new website presented a great opportunity to  begin a practical learning experience with a hands-on usability study.  The guest experience doesn't start at check in, it begins when they land on your website;  I proposed my study to the Doyle Collection management and received their enthusiastic support.</p>

<!--CASE STUDY TEXT _ DISCOVER AND DEFINE SECTION-->            
<h2>Discover and Define</h2>
        <p>To begin my study, I interviewed  different department heads and learned about what  feedback and challenges there were with the current website.  It was an ideal start to learning about their perspective, as the operations team has a lot of face to face time with  guests and had the best insight into the guest expectations, aided by what they  saw on the website.


 
</p>
    <p class="text-indent">Next, I put together a <a href="images/dupont/Dupont%20test-plan.pdf" target="_blank" class="link hvr-underline-reveal">test plan</a>, which was intended to: 1)identify the study's objectives<sup>1</sup>, 2) define the ideal participant qualifications, 3) the setting the testing environment 4) establish introduction procedures, 5) key tasks<sup>2</sup>, 6) define scenarios to achieve those tasks, and 7) develop a post-testing questionnaire. Once the test plan was completed, I searched for test participants.

<h2 class="top">Testing Overview</h2>
<p> The usability test was formatted to learn about the user’s interaction, browsing and navigation through the website.  The data collected  was primarily qualitative findings, through observations of the user behavior from visual presentations and assigned tasks.


</p> 
        
  <p class="text-indent">The actual testing took place at participants  home and/or offices, which was prefered as it was a natural environment (one participant was tested remotely), and  each session lasted between 60-90 minutes. The Users were asked to search and find the “Dupont Circle Hotel” main landing page, and describe their initial reaction and were free to browse the site, while expressing their perceptions.  The users were then assigned specific tasks and/or scenarios to navigate through, while I observed their behavior<sup>4</sup> seeking notable findings.

         <p>Generally, all participants had several issues<sup>5</sup> throughout their navigation of the site and tasks ; mostly based on content information confusion, lack of clarity while navigating and lack of clickability.  The general participant perception of the property was that the property was luxury, hip,  stylish and European- owned.

<p>Overall, this site was a  significant lesson in <strong>empathy</strong>.  Feeling and understanding what others are expressing, even if you don’t agree with them, is a powerful way of connecting.  Whether I was seeking to understand what users were looking for, or proposing an alternative solution to the client - An empathetic approach not only  sharpened my ideas, but got to the bottom of what’s relevant and important.
