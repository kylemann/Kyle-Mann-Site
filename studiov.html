    <p class="first">M<span class="small-caps">atthew</span> Viator is the owner and teacher of Studio V, a Washington DC based musicology and piano studio.  I met Matthew a few years ago when I began studying music theory, later leaving to pursue my design studies and endeavors.  I approached him to design a new website, as his studio and teaching styles had evolved immensely and needed a new web presence indicative of that change.</p>

<h2>Discover and Define</h2>
        <p>We started the project with a discussion over breakfast about the studio’s services, objectives, and needs<sup>1</sup> .My focus was to get a feel for the studio’s teaching style, what kind of brand image was desired, the ideal student, and understand the <em>why</em> behind the answers.  This was purely an informative interview, I left my worldview at the door.

<!-- User Needs-->
<p class="text-indent">After learning about the client needs, I began to identify the prospective user needs<sup>2</sup>.  Studio V hosts a monthly social, comprised of currently enrolled students, which I attended and used as an opportunity to conduct informal research.  Based on my discussions and questions to fellow students, I discovered the most important website needs for them were: location, pricing, and styles taught.   I did inquire about their thoughts on the Studio’s previous website<sup>3</sup>, which did not include: the needs listed, a logo, location, or studio images.  Students noted that the previous site did include studio policies and expectations, which they found helpful, but that they found the formatting confusing.

        <p class="text-indent">I returned to the client to discuss my findings, reservations, and confirm agreement on the edited written content.  First, I proposed that he consider revising the pricing terminology to be titled “beginner, intermediate, and advanced” vs. “proficient, technical, and professional.”  I was concerned for two reasons: 1) That the user would be confused about what pricing was appropriate for them and 2) that the terminology would affect search engine optimization (<span class="small-caps-t">SEO</span>) negatively, as a common user search would be “beginner piano lessons Washington DC”.  The client understood it was confusing, and shared concern of the <span class="small-caps-t">SEO</span> risk.  He agreed to include beginner, intermediate, and advanced, as <em>descriptive terms only</em>.  Secondly, I formatted and revised the written content for the Studio’s welcome, personal bio, lesson description, and studio policies.  The Studio policies were lengthy and unorganized, so my edits reformatted them and separated them to  be in two sections: lesson and pricing policies.  This allowed the fine print  to be more digestible and relevant to the featured topics.  The client approved the proposed edits, and the written content was ready.  Next, I set up a couple photo shoots during studio hours in order to gather  as much site collateral as possible prior to diving into design sketches.

<h2 class="top">Design and Develop</h2>
<p>My design strategy began with  reviewing the  content to identify themes, sections, and navigation architecture from the written content.  One of the key findings that influenced the final design layout is the reoccurrence of groups of three: 3 social media review links needed, 3 price structure, 3 contact details. Once I established a content structure, I started drafting layouts, sketching<sup>4</sup> one idea after another, every idea I had.

        <p class="text-indent">The most promising sketch,<em> it seemed</em>, was a single page layout with a fixed navigation to the left.  I liked this design because it offered the user a convenient navigation through the information, while allowing the content to be in a 100% viewport height container for easier reading. I drafted the mock-up design in <span class="small-caps-t">HTML/CSS</span> to see how it looked in the browser and the results were disappointing<sup>5</sup>, though there were some aspects I liked<sup>6</sup>.  In addition, the fonts the client requested<sup>7</sup> were not indicative of the studio’s desired academic, yet fun image. Since I had spent so much time designing this version, I kept trying to salvage what I had to make it better, but it just didn’t work.  This experience proved to be one of my most valuable design lessons – <strong>Don’t be afraid throw away a bad design and start over, from the beginning</strong>.

<p class="text-indent">Before going back to the drawing boards, I connected with the client to discuss the challenges with the requested fonts.  Sharing my research about Typography, I walk him through my thought process to finding the right type. Influencing my selctions, was based on the studio primary teachings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Haydn" class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">Haydn’s</a> work and other prolific classical music from the 1700’s – mid 1800’s.  I expressed the importance of the right typeface choice to properly represent the personality of his studio, and emphasized the extensive research and trial and error that goes into creating outstanding typographic styling.   The client understood and offered me full creative control in this realm, another valuable lesson,  <strong>address issues sooner, not later, don’t wait!</strong>. With that, I went back to the drawing board<sup>10</sup> with a new perspective and a fresh start.

Reaching out to fellow designers and friends,  I received some key critical feedback and findings. 1) A user reported having initial trouble going back to the home page, because there was not a link in the navigation, but eventually clicked the logo to get back.  This was an oversight on my part, though the logo was linked to the homepage, all pages needed to be included in the navigation - therefore I added the “about” to link back to the landing page. 2) Another user reported that while they liked the site welcoming design of the pages, he felt it was missing the same personal connection from Matthew, the teacher.   This influenced the final design of the contact page<sup>24</sup>, including a final statement in Matthew’s words thanking the user for visiting and inviting them to get together over coffee to discuss their musical journey.

The website was in need of some serious updating.  

I wasn't expecting nearly anything so beautiful as Kyle created.  While we did butt heads now and then over style and approach, I feel that we always understood each other on an essential level.  Having now had this website live for several months, my traffic has increased, my business' prestige has expanded, and community arts organizations that I have corporately affiliated with (The Washington Performing Arts Society, The Washington Ballet at the Kennedy Center) have commented on the professionalism and the polish of my public image and presentation.  

Kyle has elevated my business profile, been a tireless advocate for my public image, and works constantly to make sure my site is both functioning at a high level and getting noticed.  I find myself continually astonished at how dedicated Kyle has been, and how fortunate I am to have been able to work with him on this project."
