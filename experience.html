    <p class="first">C<span class="small-caps">abrina</span>, founder and operator of <i>The Experience</i>, was referred to me by my former boss, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/brian-price/1a/b4b/722" class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">Brian Price</a>, to work on a new website and brand image.  About a year ago, Cabrina began life coach consulting as a side job, and her client base grew so much that she decided to transition into a full time consultant.  This presented a great design and development opportunity, as well as an ideal partnership, since she and I were both working toward transitioning our careers.

<h2>Discover and Define</h2>
<p>Starting with a phone conversation, I began by getting to know Cabrina, learning about her background and finding out what inspires her.  As she explained to me, life coaching is very up close and personal, so it made sense to learn about her personality.  I also learned about her needs and desired outcomes<sup>1</sup> of the new website, as well as things she did not want<sup>2</sup>.  We also discussed her target customers<sup>3</sup> at length and business model for gaining new customers, which is primarily through 1) referrals of past customers and 2) sending out promotional emails about her service and links to the website.

I suggested to her that the written content stay short and concise for each service 1)state what the service does 2) what the customer can expect as an outcome, and 3) why they should sign up.  In addition, I recommended and requested that she provide testimonials of past clients.

   I began sketching layout ideas, envisioning a simple one page layout for easy navigating, reading, and a quick review.  Ultimately, the sketches led to  two promising layouts: 1)<sup>7a</sup> was a simple and clean layout that featured the content without distraction, intended for easy reading .  The second<sup>7b</sup> was more ambitious in visual design including additional colors, vertical text, and additional layers emphasizing certain headers  (layout brainstorming <span class="small-caps-t">PDF</span>: <a href="images/experience/desktopmockup.pdf" class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">desktop</a> and <a href="images/experience/mobileversion.pdf" class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">mobile</a> version).  Both were intriguing and I developed them in  <span class=”small-caps-t”>HTML/CSS</span> to compare the designs in the browser.

        <p class="text-indent">Once developed, I became very attached to 7b, but was still unsure which one to move forward with. Deciding to shelf the decision between the two layouts, in the interim, I worked on the areas both designs shared in common: 1) the header, 2) logo, and 3) contact section.  I wanted to ensure the landing page was warm, inviting, friendly, and humble, yet confident.  Guided by my initial client interview with Cabrina, I brainstormed  different header taglines<sup>8</sup>,.  After working through a number of ideas, none of them were appropriate or indicative of the services offered, so I consolidated  a list<sup>9</sup> of what I didn’t like to have a clear vision of my direction.  The final outcome<sup>10</sup> was a statement of simplicity: “Let’s begin a Journey of Change” - “One session, one discovery, one goal at a time ”.  The reasoning for this header was threefold - 1) it stated the intention of all the services which is “Change”  2) it stated the services to fulfill that objective, being “one session, one discovery, one goal at a time”, and 3) it mirrored the voice of Cabrina’s personality and the key objectives of her service.

<p class="text-indent">In finding the right imagery for the site I was initially tempted to use photos of Cabrina with a client, but that was too business-like and had the connotation of therapy.   A number of her clients are stay at home mothers, and having business-like photos pigeonholed the services to business consulting and sent the wrong message of her services overall.  Reminding myself of the variety of different customer personas and the client need of <em>holistic styling</em>, I turned to nature.  Nature offered pictures of warmth, serenity and help assemble a palette of calming colors.

<p class="text-indent">I had been sketching logo ideas throughout the process, but having been unsuccessful so far, I decided to write down exactly what I wanted the Logo<sup>11</sup> to signify and then started over with a vision.  With a new direction, I began sketching a lot of shapes, primarily triangles, with the idea of <a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html" class="link hvr-underline-reveal" target="_blank">Maslow’s “Hierarchy of Needs”</a> relating to Life Coaching.  While I liked the concept, I ultimately  decided  not to use the triangular shape as a <em>main focus</em>, because its connotation insinuates <em>moving up</em>, rather than the  emphasis on clients <em>moving forward</em>.   This guided me to the final result<sup>12</sup>of  a circular graphic that has a sense of motion, intertwined with another inner circle adding visual motion and signifying partnerships.   The circular foundation included a square on the inside, which by connection to the circle forms <em>subtle</em> triangles, indicative of the structured progress toward change <em>The Experience</em> team offers.

<p class="text-indent">Overall, it was clear that that while the second design was more visually intriguing, it was less likely to be read thoroughly - taking away from the key objective.  Once again a great learning opportunity -<strong> just because it’s pretty doesn't mean anything if it’s not useful</strong>.

<p>The project overall was a grand lesson in <strong>perspective</strong> -  The client's perspective, my perspective, the personas and the real life user’s perspective.   Everyone has different investments, objectives, and goals, which need to be carefully considered .  In this project, my perspective was creating an ambitious design and, therefore, was initially drawn to a design that didn't fully meet the needs of the client.  I learned the importance of objectively identifying the perspectives  for all parties involved, setting aside my own motifs, and designing accordingly.  The client's message was simple and clear, and in the end that’s the message that resonates in the final design.
